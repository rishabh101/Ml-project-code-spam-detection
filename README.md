# Ml-project-code-spam-detection
CodeProject is a community of software developers joined together with certain common goals: to learn, to teach, and to have fun. members from all over the world come together to share code, tutorials, and knowledge for free to help their fellow software developers.  However, CodeProject’s forums are being overrun with spam questions from beginners who don’t care to first do a Google search. The amount of spam on the website is more than can be manually filtered through.  Create a model, which when given various details about a question and the account, can predict whether the question should be deleted, and also predict the reason for deletion (from a small set of standard reasons i.e multiclass classification).  The classes for the target are  0: "valid", 1: "kehna kya chahte ho" 2: "irrelevant" 3: "low quality" 4: "not reproducible"
